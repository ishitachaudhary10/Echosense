EchoSense is an AI-powered assistive communication system designed to bridge the gap between individuals with speech and hearing impairments and the hearing population through real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition and speech/text translation. This innovative project combines computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing into a seamless pipeline that recognizes hand gestures and converts them into spoken language with high accuracy and minimal delay.

The core architecture of EchoSense comprises three key components: gesture recognition using Mediapipe, classification using the XGBoost machine learning model, and speech/text output via Google’s Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and translation APIs. Mediapipe enables accurate hand landmark detection in real-time video streams, providing 21-point hand keypoints per frame. These features are then fed into a trained XGBoost classifier, which identifies static ASL letters and digits. Finally, the recognized gesture is translated to speech and/or multilingual text, enabling effective communication between signers and non-signers.

Extensive testing was conducted on a dataset of 195 ASL gesture samples. The system achieved a remarkable 94% overall accuracy in sign recognition, with many signs scoring a perfect 1.00 in precision and recall. The overall weighted F1-score was 0.94, highlighting the robustness and consistency of the model. EchoSense also demonstrated low-latency response times, making it suitable for fast-paced, real-world interactions. Additionally, it performed reliably across diverse lighting conditions — from bright indoor settings to low-light environments — underscoring its practical usability.

Beyond its technical strengths, EchoSense stands out for its accessibility-focused design. It features a user-friendly interface with customizable settings, making it adaptable for users with varying levels of tech literacy. The system supports multilingual output, broadening its utility across different linguistic backgrounds.

In conclusion, EchoSense is a significant step toward inclusive communication technology. Its ability to translate ASL into speech and text in real time not only empowers individuals with speech and hearing impairments but also enhances interaction in educational, professional, and public environments. With further enhancements like wearable integration and expanded gesture vocabulary, EchoSense holds the potential to become a global standard in sign language translation and accessibility tools.
